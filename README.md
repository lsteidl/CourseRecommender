# CourseRecommender

Recommender

Problem 1 (1.25 points)

    Fetch data from server: https://mysqlcs639.cs.wisc.edu/students/5022025924/classes/completedLinks to an external site.
    Create a new component to represent previously taken courses. This component will look somewhat like the Course component, but it will be simpler and wonâ€™t have options to add the course to the cart.
    Create a new component to hold the previously taken courses. Make this component accessible from the app. 

 

Problem 2 (1.25 points)

    Create a component for rating a specific course.
    Allow the user to rate courses they have already taken.

 

Problem 3 (1.25 points)

    Generate a list of interest areas based on the course data (maybe look at subjects and keywords?)
    Create a component for the user to select interest areas as defined in step 1.
    Make this component available to the user.

 

Problem 4 (1.25 points)

    Create the recommender algorithm that takes in the rated courses and interest areas. Search through subjects and keywords to find the courses most similar to the highly rated courses and the courses that match the most interest areas
    Display the recommended courses to the user. (Maybe click a button in search to pop up a modal with a few recommended courses or sort all courses by their recommendation score)

 

General (1 point)

Projects will be graded on the general usability and design of the system. You should consider the way the users navigate around the application, and other concepts covered in design lecture.
